RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROJECT

1.Poor estimations and scheduling

Estimating the time required to deliver a successful project may be very hard,so sometimes the project much more time to come into completion.

2.A sudden increase of projects requirements

As the project continues,we can notice that,we might have forgotten to include some of the requirements during the early stages,so a heavy work must be done to ensure that those requirements are included in the project.

3.Sudden change in budget

During project development,the change in expected budget has caused delay of project completion.

4.Existing technology does not support a comprehensive development of the project.

The existing technology required for the development is only in its initial stage with no advanced technology available

5.Poor productivity of the development team

Irresponsible development team can lead to a poor development of the software,so this is a very huge risk which affects the overall project

6.Stakeholder Expectations.

The stakeholder of the project might have a different version of the project which is totally different from yours.

7.Poor quality code

If the quality of the code is poor,always this leads to countless changes in the future.
